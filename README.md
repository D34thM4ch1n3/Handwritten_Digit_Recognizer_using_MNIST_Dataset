# Handwritten_Digit_Recognizer_using_MNIST_Dataset
This project implements a Handwritten Digit Recognition system using the MNIST dataset — one of the most widely used benchmark datasets in machine learning and computer vision. The model is trained to classify digits from 0 to 9 using a neural network built with TensorFlow and Keras, developed entirely on Google Colab.
